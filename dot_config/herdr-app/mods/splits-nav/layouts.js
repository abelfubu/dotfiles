// Pure rules for mounting this mod into every layout. No host imports, so node
// can test them directly (selftest.mjs).
//
// Herdr runs a mod only where a layout mounts it: without a copy of its own in
// the shown layout, the keys bound to `<mod>.<command>` reach nothing at all.
// So every layout the person owns gets one, added to the root's floats as a
// block that renders nothing. Herdr's own layouts are replaced whole on every
// start, so a write into one would be migrated to `<name>-edited` on the next
// start and re-injected forever (a new file and a toast each start). For the
// ones this mod is for — Herdr ("main") and Terminals — a personal `<name>-nav`
// copy is made instead, once; Herdr's other layouts (Herdr 98, and any it ships
// later) are left alone.
//
// Idempotent by construction: a layout that already mounts the mod anywhere in
// its tree (block or float, however deep) is left untouched, and a copy is made
// only while nothing personal derives from that layout.
